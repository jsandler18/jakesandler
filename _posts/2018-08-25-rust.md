At University of Maryland: College Park, I was a teaching assistant for a mid-level programming course called "Organization of Programming Languages".  Up until this
course, students are only exposed to Java and C, which share a lot of syntax and semantics.  The point of this course is to introduce students to entirely different
programming languages, and to give students more tools in their programming toolbelt.  For a long time, we did this by teaching three languages that are vastly different
from each other and from what they have previously learned.  We taught them Ruby as their first scripting language, OCaml as their first functional language, and Prolog
as their first Logical language.  

The scripting and functional language paradigms are good tools for programmers to know, as many real software projects take advantage of them.  Logic programming, though
interesting and unique, is not very practical.  There are tons of new, interesting, and, most importantly, practical languages out there these days, so we decided to
replace Prolog in our curriculum.  We chose to replace it with Rust!

## Why Rust
Like I said, there are *plenty* of interesting and practical languages out there, of which Rust is only one.  Some of the languages we were deciding between include:
* Rust
* Go
* Javascript
* Haskell

So why Rust? Well Haskell is quite similar to OCaml, so not much new would be gained from teaching it.  There is already another elective that teaches full stack web
development with nodeJS, so JS is already covered.  That leaves Go and Rust.  Either would have been a good pick, as both fit the criteria of being interesting and
practical.  Ultimately, there were three main reasons Rust beat Go:
* It has many similarities to OCaml, so the semantics can be related back to a language that is fresh in the student's minds
* Students have learned C, so they know the pain of manual memory management, but they do not know any solution to this pain besides garbage collection and getting good
* The professor teaching the class worked on [the Cyclone Language](https://cyclone.thelanguage.org/), which pioneered many of the safety features that Rust boasts

So Rust replaced Prolog! As a Rust fanboy, this made me very happy! Also as a Rust fanboy, I got stuck with creating large parts of the new curriculum, since I was the
only TA who knew the language already.

## How we taught Rust
In order to teach Rust we had to create lecture slides to show the students during class.  Luckily, there is a [free
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/index.html) that teaches everything a beginner could ever want to know about Rust.  All we had to do was convert the
relevant sections of the book into a form that made sense in a slide deck.  I say "all we had to do", but this was actually a fairly laborious process.  We could not get 
every topic from the book in, as we had a fairly limited amount of time to teach this (about 3 weeks).  Despite this, we made sure to fit the stuff that makes Rust
interesting: 
* Ownership
* Memory Management
* Mutability
* Lifetimes
* Traits
* Structs and Enums
* Closures and Iterators
* Smart Pointers

In addition to slides, we also needed a sizeable programming assignment in Rust so students could get actually work with the language.  This project was modeled after
the introductory OCaml and Prolog projects.  It started with a few standalone toy functions that help students begin to dig into the language without being too
intimidating.  Examples of such functions are calculating the mean of a slice of floats and performing a binary search on a sorted slice.  

Most new Rust programmers have experienced "fighting the borrow checker". In this fight, the programmer writes code that would be "fine" in something like C, but the Rust
compiler does not deem it to be safe, and so does not compile.  As the programmer learns the rules, they fight the borrow checker less and less often.  It is an important
part of learning the language.  The second part of the project attempted to force students into the fight by presenting them with prewritten code that does pass the
borrow checker and ask them to correct it.  Most of the examples involve illegally returning references or attempting to use a value after being moved.

The third part was intended to illustrate one of the advantages of traits over traditional Java-style interfaces.  It involved defining a trait for a FIFO queue and then
implementing it for the `Vec<T>` type. This is fairly straightforward but it is meant to illustrate that defining functionality for a type in Rust is not something that
only the author of that type is restricted to!  

The final part was to implement a generic binary search tree.  This gives experience using the heap-allocation smart pointer, `Box<T>`, as well as using built in operators
such as <, >, and == on generic types that are bounded by operator traits.

Students would only be tested on Rust on their final exam.  Since the time spent on Rust was so small, the Rust section of the exam was worth less than 15% of the overall
score.

## What Didn't Work
Since this was a new curriculum, there are certainly some areas that could be improved.  As you may have noticed, the parts of the programming assignment were very
disjointed, and maybe a bit too easy.  Each part was an isolated mini-project meant to illustrate one part of the language.  It was done this way mostly becuase that is how the
Prolog project was written.  It was just me writing this project as I was the only TA that knew the language when the project needed to be written, and I did not really have
the time, creativity, or manpower to come up with something more connected, interesting, and challenging.  Hopefully future TAs that learned the language in class can
pool their manpower and improve the project.

Additionally, the test questions on Rust that I wrote were just bad.  Some of the questions were too esoteric and the rubric had to be relaxed, while others were way
too easy and nearly eveyone answered correctly.  Normally TAs make questions by taking questions from previous semesters and changing them around a bit.  I sincerely hope
that they don't refer to my questions, and that they throw them away and start over.

Also, Rust is still a young language that is under (very) active deveolpment! Many of the pain points that students had about learning the language are being actively
worked on or fixed!  One such example is [match ergonomics](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/05/10/Rust-1.26.html#nicer-match-bindings).  Before this patch, matching on
a reference required a very non-obvious and unergonomic idiom.  Many students struggled with this in their projects, and then was fixed a few days after the project
concluded.  Another pain point was the ability to nest method calls.  An example is: `vec.push(vec.pop())`.  This code is correct, but the borrow checker believes that
there are two borrows of `vec` going on at the same time, one for `push` and one for `pop`.  We know that these calls are in sequence and not at the same time, so no
borrow error should happen, but it does.  This is actively being worked on with Non-Lexical Lifetimes

Lastly, we left out a lot of stuff that is pretty important, but just didn't make the cut.  We did not talk at all about topics like threads, modules, and crates.  The
biggest (in my opinion) topic that was left out was error handling with `Result<T,E>`.  I think this is a great error handling type with many neat methods to help handle
the errors, but we simply did not have the time.

## What Worked
The lectures seemed to do a good job at teaching the concepts of Rust to students.  Most students I spoke with at office hours seemed to grasp owenership, references, and even lifetimes without too much
trouble.  

That is pretty much it, but having a large body of students grasp the core concepts of Rust outweighs all of the problems that we had!  Ultimately, I think Rust is a
worthy successor to Prolog in this course, as long as the curriculum is fine tuned over time.  

At the very least, this was a course with nearly 400 students in it.  There is a very good chance that at least a few of those students found Rust genuinely interesting,
and will go on to explore more of it themselves.  As a Rust evangalist, this thought makes me very happy :)
